# Conversation Transcript

## December 13, 2024

**Human**: I am a Salesforce consultant working for Simplus, a Salesforce consultancy. We are attempting to rework a lot of the internal infrastructure and processes currently in place, and we had our first group meeting last week. Our long term goal is to restructure Simplus into a company with minimal red tape, AI engrained into all of our infrastructure, and team structures that lends itself to collaboration and a meaningful bidirectional feedback. Our group is known as "Delta Force". A transcript of our 1st meeting can be found here: @Delta Force, Assemble - 2024_12_13 12_29 MST - Transcript.md.
