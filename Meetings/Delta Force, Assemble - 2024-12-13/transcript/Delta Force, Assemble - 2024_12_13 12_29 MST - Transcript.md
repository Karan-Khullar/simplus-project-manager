# **Transcript**

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: There we go.

Kyle Johnson: Thank Marshall, I know we talked earlier about just kind of our sales process right now and how it's pretty limited capacity wise and our ability to get to clients and sell sometimes the right services. just wondering if kind of you could elaborate on that a little bit too and kind of fill in the rest of us here that aren't as familiar with the sales process and how we can help you there.

Marshall Taylor: to you guys. But just understanding having more accountability from our sales people is what's going to be our biggest thing managed services for strategic services moving forward. we have Nick basically, right? That can sorry, give me just a second here. I got to drop this call.  we just don't have anybody that really knows how to manage services or strategic services, excuse me. that's the biggest thing is we just need support there. I think if we're actually going to look at growing the pipeline and we need to understand how do we as far as the CSM, you guys don't have any AES left to work with. So, nobody really gets in there and does anything for you as far as trying to drive your accounts forward.

Marshall Taylor: And I don't know that there's anybody that's actually going in there and seeing what's happening to see if there's opportunities there. I know that's something that Jess was working with Honey on with BTS. as far as finding new ideas of way we could implement new features into existing customers. so whether that's through AI or some kind of possible transformation project, I know that that was touched on in one of the company meetings too.  So, I think that's always a good idea is to have Honey's team come in and look and at a project and see where there's areas for improvements that have possibly been stagnant. but I mean, at this point, we had 30 AES and now we're down to four.

Marshall Taylor: So the number of AES is nothing at this point, but the number of AES that can actually sell strategic services is one. And s Other than that, it just all falls on Jess and I to sell strategic services if we have a new opportunity. no.

Kyle Johnson: So, even if we start coming up with, more clients that are potentially interested, you just don't have the time to meet with everyone.

Marshall Taylor: Time. I will make time.

Kyle Johnson: Done. …

Marshall Taylor: I mean, that's part of what I do here is that's my role as sales is to make time for them.

Marshall Taylor: It's just we need to find opportunities, leads for people that want to have a partner come in and partner with them long term.

Kyle Johnson:

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: them directly to Marshall. You can send them directly to Pete Lensold is also available for strategic services deals. I'm working with him on three pods for travelers right now. I gave him a lead and I gave Nick five leads. So they're what ready, willing, and able to take it on. So please, if you know of a company that has Salesforce or should have Salesforce, doesn't hurt to share it.

Kyle Johnson: their Salesforce system. haven't gotten a bill from them for four months because they can't do things correctly in their own system. and that's kind of stuff that, we should definitely be ing hitting it hard. I attend school online. It's Western Governor's University and, we've had that as an opportunity before. but we just keep hitting people like that. And anywhere and everywhere that our consultants go, just ask that simple question. what do you guys use? what's it based on?

Kyle Johnson: especially hell interacting with an online site and it's a pain in the butt to work with or something like that and you figure out it's Salesforce on the back end that's a lead that's the kind of stuff that we can all do better I think myself especially included at getting that information out there and then how do we get everybody else to do that too how do we kind of drive home that hey you're a consultant and just start thinking about that big picture even just at the supermarket

### 00:05:00

Kyle Johnson: wondering about what do they use and could we work with them? Yeah.

Kyle Cochrane: I think it's one thing to kind of get those to work to develop those leads in a very ad hoc way but if we don't have a team actually going out and sourcing those then you won't develop any consistent pipeline for strategic services.  So I guess the question really should be is what is in place and what could be in place to have a strategic services start to develop its own pipeline. what would that take?

Kyle Johnson: Marshall, you might be able to touch on just kind of trying to sell things and always being the cheapest, but we don't want to be the cheapest. and if we're going to really build our pipeline, like you're saying, right, we need the people to implement it, but we also need to sell the right things and do the right things and not shoot ourselves in the foot. and not just take things because it's there, right?

Marshall Taylor: I think we need to understand what the scope of managed services work is too, there's sometimes when we get reached out to by a client and we don't understand what the exact scope of work is and we get strategic services into a place where we probably shouldn't be with a full-blown integration where we probably be more suited as a company to have somebody like Honey's team or our delivery team look at that while we continue to handle things in the background and then transition us back onto the project as a longer term

Marshall Taylor: term projection because one thing I see with a lot of people when I go into sales calls is that not the client doesn't look at us but simplest delivery and BTS look at us as an afterthought. So if we can figure out a way to play the longer game with BTS and delivery that's going to only help our cause too. delivery is just looking for an implementation of financial service cloud or whatever. BTS just wants that business transformation service. We're not showing them that once that is complete that we have the full breadth of capability to jump back in there.  So,

Kyle Johnson: And another thing that comes in that too is just handing things off from delivery to us and then we operate differently than they do. not being on the same page just in general about that stuff and something that we can all work on to do better. But that brings up, why is delivery really so much different than us? Why aren't we all the same group? We're the same company, right?

Kyle Johnson: I mean, they should be looking at us, as fellows, and selling deals with us involved and actively involving us because we're all here together and we're not going to succeed unless we do this together, and looking at a deal from their end and saying, " all we care about is implementing this." It's like, that's great. You can implement it and then we can do phase two, we can do phase three, whatever. We can do anything that you all can do just the same. It's just we have to have that long-term plan.  And like you're saying, we can't just sell a product, right? We've got to sell ideas. yeah, that's I mean, Kyle C, what do you think? I mean, especially with the Certenia thing and Kuran getting thrown into that.

Kyle Johnson: Yeah.

Kyle Cochrane: Yeah, I mean I think it just goes back to having more sales support. Marshall said, there's only one person and that ain't going to cut it. but then you have to back up and say, we're under the thumb of Infosys now. How much are they willing to invest in us? So, …

Kyle Johnson: Yeah. Yeah. It's completely fair. Yeah. I mean,…

Kyle Cochrane: and I think that probably does,…

Kyle Johnson: Jody, could we even get another

Kyle Cochrane: they're probably used to trying to sell us as a package deal as part of a delivery project and not going out there and finding, clients that would bring in a new, managed services provider you just out of the blue. So,

### 00:10:00

Kyle Johnson: And I mean right now Jody are we actively really looking for somebody to help out in that regard and kind of I guess does anybody here have any ideas of who somebody you've worked with before or I mean Marshall heck somebody from Cognizant days. Billy

Marshall Taylor: cognizant. It was the biggest thing we're going to run into here is that Infosys historically is an application takeover company. They will take over the entire technology platform for a customer. So that includes Microsoft, Adobe, whatever Salesforce, Docyign, they look at us as that too, but that's not who we are.  And I think the disconnect comes from is Infosys might not understand who we are as a practice. we deal with Salesforce very specifically which is a very niche part of the technology ecosystem as a whole, if you look at Kamasu for example, Kamasu probably uses every technology under the sun because they're such a large corporation and we're just one small piece of that for them.

Marshall Taylor: they pro and Jody you don't have to correct me if I'm wrong but a company that size they're using Oracle they're using SAP they're using Salesforce and that's what Infosys has made their money on is they come in and they take over these huge applications and that's always been their mindset and so when we go in on some of these deals they're not just looking at Salesforce they want to take over it all instead of just saying hey this is our very specific Salesforce  team. This is who they are. This is how they operate. They want the whole thing. And unfortunately, that's what Infosys wants us to sell, too, is just enterprise clientele, which are these huge contracts, which are great when you can get them signed, but they're so few and far in between.

Marshall Taylor: the reality of it is the reality of us walking into a strategic services deal and signing 10 15 20 HTE FTEES is It's very slim.  What we are designed to do is we are designed to deploy five or six people to work as an extension of somebody's team to truly act as like an arm, as a partnership to them to make sure that we have their future in mind and that we're protecting what they've invested in and that we're improving those while reducing cost for them is an overall not reducing cost in the amount that they're paying us, but the amount of cost that they're spending on the entire application.

Marshall Taylor: That's what people want. They want when you go in and you talk to a CTO, they understand all the technical stuff, But the other guy that's in there that's like, do when I click on Salesforce, does it work? How much money am I losing because of this? That's what we lack too from the Infosys perspective.

Marshall Taylor: Excuse me.

Kyle Johnson: Yeah, something just brainstorming here.

Kyle Johnson: Again kind of taking it from our days at ATG but the quick ramp PC's that we used to do to get deals going blindly at a customer basically and putting two or three people on it to where they have an idea they know enough about the customer to be able to create something that would be valuable to them.

Kyle Johnson: And then we go into a sales meeting basically with already a product being created even in a base form something that would immediately add value to them. we can show without having any interactions with them previously that we know just enough already to be able to make something to benefit imagine what we can do in the future and just something But yeah, being able to get support for you, Marshall. again, where can we look to get other people to sell things actively selling? I mean, I am willing to travel for sure. I'm willing to do anything that it takes to find us deals, too. And

### 00:15:00

Marshall Taylor: problem is that we're always going to run into infosys. That's the thing is all we can sell our asses off we can sell 100 hour contracts but is deep going to sign off on that. That's where we're going to get jammed up if that's not what they're looking for. They have a specific criteria that they want to meet and I get we're a huge conglomeration, that's what they have to do to keep the wheels turning. it's not realistic really. if I were able to close this JMA deal, we have to hire all of these people and hire an in-person CSN, which right?

Marshall Taylor: And so it's like, but if we just approach this from a twoerson perspective, hey, we're just going to start you with two devs to see how it works. Just provide you production support or provide you, a small CI/CD team. That's historically where we've made our bread and butter and that adds up quick. that's but again, we have to get sign off from higher up and that's not what they have us targeting.

Kyle Johnson: And right now, do we have a lot of accounts remaining that have grown significantly with us over the years and the number of seats that we have active account wise, just to back up kind of the data that hey, we started with one person, now we have 12 or something like that.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Weston back in 2021 it was a team of four people and now it's bringing in a million dollars a year. So, we've been able to identify opportunities. We've been able to build that trust. and now we've got an experience cloud pod and we've got a full-time developer that does his own thing.  And then we were helping with part and marketing cloud and now Karan you're there as well. So there's a lot of different moving parts that we've been able to do and there's still room for growth there which is why Karan was strategically put in there because they're going to need architect support.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: So, just that one as an example it's a really good example and…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: they've had a lot of turnover, but they're still super happy and they're still giving us more business.

Kyle Johnson: That's awesome.

Kyle Johnson: And I mean, how can we go to Deepo and just say, "Hey, this is an example of what we've been able to historically do, And just give us a green light. Just give us a chance on one or two of these deals and let us show you that this is the path forward for the revenue that you're seeking. We got to start somewhere." But historically, this is the way that we've been able to do it and build that trust. And it's not always through the big deals, But because we have even one or two of our personnel are able to build that rapport. I think that we really need one of the things that we should do here is just kind of gather that data and be able to present …

Kyle Johnson: our side of the story basically. Are you guys Yeah.

Marshall Taylor: Adrian.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: And we did just recently do that specifically for Lamb Weston with Deepo.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: So that's another reason why it was fresh in my mind. we did that within the last two months. but we could do it with more

Kyle Johnson: And just kind of getting at least some form of lesser red tape surrounding those engagements and just giving us a chance to do it.

Kyle Johnson: Rome wasn't built overnight and we don't also know what these companies are going to be in a few years. I mean, they could be huge. They could fold. We just don't know. but getting our foot in the door is better than not being there at all.

Karan Rajkhullar: What…

Karan Rajkhullar: what was the reception from Deep Talk when you guys presented Lamb Weston as an example?

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: what we've been able to do. I'll be honest, when we first started that project, it like we were getting the lead consultant that was supposed to start on that project, she was brand new to Simplus, she quit the day before. She never even joined Simplest. So, we had to scramble and find a lead. So, the first three weeks of the engagement, we didn't have a lead. we were also there to provide partardot support. We were given somebody from our Philippines team that was supposed to be a part expert who had minimal experience one time. so what ended up happening through all of that was Aaron Meltchure, myself and Jess ended up putting our brains together and somehow putting together some part stuff that was successful.

### 00:20:00

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: but once we got beyond that, we started really building a great relationship with Chris and his team over there. And once he realized that we were actually here to help and grow, they kept throwing more things over the fence to us. So, it's that key of them getting that trust. And I think some of our clients see us and they appreciate us, but I don't know that they trust us.  So, they're doing an okay job, like nothing's breaking, but they're not wowing us either. I think we need to get to that point where they say, "We can't live without this team.

Karan Rajkhullar: I think that story just in general what you just told me is such a compelling case for that because now they've grown to such a large account because we prove to them that we're there for them despite having adversity on our end.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah.

Karan Rajkhullar: So, I think that's good. I definitely think if we could come up with a few more cases where that happened in the positive maybe even negative cases to show the opposite of why big enterprise accounts sometimes won't work. I feel like we could create a compelling case to Deepo for us to try out a few projects that K just to give us a shot with the type of project that we thrive with, Yeah.

Kyle Johnson: Yeah, definitely right there with you. another one that comes to mind is Starbucks. I mean, that could be huge. it's going to grow hopefully, right? And we started out.

Marshall Taylor: But that hold on that started out as an Infosys deal, That was an Infosys project that got kicked to us.

Kyle Johnson: Yes. All right.

Marshall Taylor: And so we got to be careful using that because that could get used against us, too, where they're like, " this was our deal. we did a whole app takeover and look at the way that Infosys has provided you guys with work. Clearly, we need to go after these bigger accounts if this is the only way we can grow them."  That's exactly what Deepo's going to tell you is that look at you guys have been able to grow this account from these two people to here because this started out as our deal like we have to be able to provide from just the simplest stance.

Karan Rajkhullar: and…

Kyle Johnson: But would we have been able to go

Karan Rajkhullar: just to add to that, no, I was just going to add just from my experience on Starbucks, a lot of Infosys's way of working was kind of imposed on us even on the  ground level. So I agree with Marshall. I don't think that Starbucks is probably the best example just because not only did it originate from emphasis, but the way that we operated was largely how Infosys wanted us to operate during the actual project.

Kyle Johnson: Would they have had the same results…

Karan Rajkhullar: I don't think so. Yeah.

Kyle Johnson: though if it was all Inthosis resources?

Marshall Taylor: They will tell you yes whether we say to you infosys is going to tell you 120% they probably would have had better results is…

Kyle Johnson: And that's Yeah.

Marshall Taylor:

Marshall Taylor: what they'll tell you. It's a sales gig,…

Kyle Johnson: Yeah. Yeah.

Marshall Taylor: my man.

Kyle Johnson: Yeah. We just got to keep proving ourselves and proving that we're different than anybody that they can throw on a project,

Marshall Taylor: And I agree. And like I said, the Select Health deals, those are great deals where we're able to staff a large number of people right out of the gate and then grow from there with just our simplest team. Select Health is another perfect example of that we need to be able to showcase better. it's  Andrew, what do you think? You've gone through the sales ringer a bunch of times.

Andrea Ingmire: I don't know if I've gone through the sales ringer. you were helping out with the APS renewal and the micro project that Kyle's working on now. That's I don't know. I'm just kind of sitting back and taking it all in and thinking about what our options are cuz I kind of feel like I keep thinking we're almost in a chicken or the egg situation. we need to be able to prove ourselves and get Deepo to give us these opportunities to prove that we can do it, but then we need to make sure that we have the people that are actually going to back us up and prove it. and I think one of our biggest challenges right now is we have a lot of people that just kind of don't really care too much anymore.

### 00:25:00

Andrea Ingmire: And that's something that I feel like I'm fighting every day is again the chicken or the egg thing is like if we don't believe and act that we are the best, then how do we get people to drum up the motivation to fix that and start proving again that we're the best,

Kyle Johnson: we offer them, what would be the outcome? Yeah. And part of that, right, is on us as a company. Part of that is on just the situation that we're in because of Banthos's takeover and because of so many people leaving and just not enough of us to go around to drive home the champion mindset, but we can all do that together and we can't let this stuff beat us down constantly, every day is a new day and we just go into it and do the best. And I know that each of us here do that. but we have to spread that, And it's got to go across the board and we have to raise a red flag immediately when we've got somebody who's either just checking out or just not up to our standards. are we better off without some people that end up creating more work for everyone else?

Marshall Taylor: I actually have missed two calls now from teams for a sales deal. So, I need to jump and go see what's going on there.

Kyle Johnson: Get out of here.

Andrea Ingmire: Yeah. Yeah.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Marshall, that deal that he's bouncing to is a $1.2 million deal,…

Andrea Ingmire: Yeah. Thanks,…

Kyle Johnson: Get her done.

Andrea Ingmire: Marshall. Right.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: so please go.

Kyle Johnson: Yeah. Yeah.

Andrea Ingmire: They needed onsite CSM in Florida. Yeah.

Kyle Johnson: Holy cow. Dustin Perez splits his time down there.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yep. So, yeah,…

Kyle Johnson: He could drop in.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: but he doesn't want to be in an office.

Kyle Johnson: Yeah, that's fair. I can't blame him there. If it was just a winter thing, I'll do

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah. Hey.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Honestly guys, that's a really great point about people and I don't know if you guys are aware if you've even looked at any of the dashboards or anything, but for the month of November, we were at 86% utilized. And while that's an amazing number and finally we are above 80 and things are looking good, what that means for us is we've got to hire because that means that our bench is non-existent. So we've got some people that are starting over the next 3 weeks, but we also have people that are rolling off of a pretty big project in H Heartland.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: And so what we're going to be able to do is adjust things and bring in those champions that you guys are speaking about and bring in those people that want to be here and they want to bust it every day. the Kaisers of the world, the Kurans, the the Kyles, the Andreas. we have people that are available now that are pretty good names and pretty good players in the game that I think we could kind of hone in and be like an extension of this Delta Champions group, I think it's a really perfect time for this to all start and I'm really excited to see what this group can do.

Karan Rajkhullar: And al sorry. No, I was just going to mention I would love to help with the interviewing process as well, especially from a technical standpoint. I would love to do that. and…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Thank you.

Karan Rajkhullar: and I also wanted to add something to what Andrea mentioned a little bit ago about how we need to have the people to back it up.  I also think that we need the infrastructure to kind of breed those people. that's the part that I'm extremely passionate about. I actually have something whipped up that I can show you guys at the end of the call if you guys want. A part of it. Yeah. but yeah, I think if we can identify the champions that exist within us now, if we can build an interview process that weeds out anyone who isn't of that mindset and isn't of that caliber, and if we can also create a learning infrastructure internally that can take the people who are on the edge of being at that level or

### 00:30:00

Karan Rajkhullar: or we see the potential for them to be at that level. I don't think there's any way we can't succeed in what we're planning here. So that's just my overall take on what general direction we should probably take going forward

Kyle Johnson: for junior resources, even if sometimes they frustrate us. it's not all their fault, people sometimes haven't been given all the tools to succeed or they're put in, just basically untenable positions where they don't really know what they're doing on a project. And it's not always related to technical things. Sometimes it's related to just how a business works, what they what they sell, business terms, jargon, that's another thing that we can really do to drive home is that soft skills thing.  And I know that they've done some work on that offshore, but what more can we do to up those soft skills for the offshore resources?

Andrea Ingmire: work that we're supporting. a lot of the boot camps are very very specifically narrow focused technical stuff.

Kyle Johnson: Yeah, he's mad.

Andrea Ingmire: There he is. the one I hear about all the time.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: We were on a call yesterday and…

Karan Rajkhullar: You want to help out?

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: he was making all sorts of appearances. This

Karan Rajkhullar: You want to join? Yeah.

Andrea Ingmire: I added a lot. but yeah, I think part of the challenge especially with offshore like you're saying it's not their fault they're being kind of put into an unfair situation I think there's an aspect of so many good people have left that Philippines leadership is just terrified for anyone else to leave and so it's causing a lot of standards to be lowered people aren't being held accountable stuff's not getting fixed when it needs

Andrea Ingmire: and I think it has kind of led to this overall level of just because they know no one's going to do anything and I think it's kind of on our level standard we hold people just purely out of fear and then also not to pay people enough to bring in good people and I think that's one of those points where emphasis is hamstringing us also So that's almost like maybe they're always giving every problems and…

Kyle Johnson: Yeah. And can we open up more salary opportunities by drop exactly…

Andrea Ingmire: hire one really good person instead of having those two people's salaries kind of thing.

Kyle Johnson: what I'm thinking. Yep. And how do we identify those people and how do we give them an opportunity to still succeed?

Kyle Johnson: But in the end, it doesn't work out. I mean, you can't. It's the square peg round hole thing.

Andrea Ingmire: And how do I identify the people…

Andrea Ingmire: who we really have already given plenty of opportunities to succeed and they still aren't?

Kyle Johnson: Yep. Yeah. You get three strikes and you don't get 30\.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: And I think just maybe for this group's knowledge, it is very difficult at a last resort let somebody go in the Philippines. Andrea, I can speak to this to you because you deal with this.  Essentially, if we have an issue, if we don't log it into a tracker, and this is for Kyle and Karan, if we don't log it into a tracker, it doesn't exist, And so the problem is that is twofold. There's a tab on this tracker for the Philippines and there's a tab on the tracker for North America.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: There is not a single entry on the North America tab because culturally the Philippines team doesn't want to put anything on there. But in turn there are dozens of entries on the Philippines tab. And we don't actually want to put them on either, but we have to.  And the problem is we're seeing some very similar names over and over again. And for somebody in Andrea's position, that's frustrating because is something getting done or not? And that's where we need to kind of get a little bit better in our process of how are we holding people accountable.

### 00:35:00

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: what happened to the DEIA committee that was focusing on accountability. It's not having meetings anymore. and…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: I can say that because I was on that committee. right.

Andrea Ingmire: And I'm still on that committee and…

Andrea Ingmire: every meeting we have ever gets pushed. But also probably at this point threearters of the original members are not here anymore. And a lot of what we were focusing on was around hiring…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah. It Yeah.

Andrea Ingmire:

Andrea Ingmire: which then we stopped doing. So,

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: So, the three of us I was on a committee with Kendra Brown and Jenny Parsons, both of which luckily are still here. Our focus was accountability. and that just fizzled out really fast. I think we all agreed that it was just too much for only the three of us to take on.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: But we do need to figure out hey we have somebody who is on this incident tracker six times about performance issues. What is being done to one either train them coach them motivate them or what do we plan on doing with this person because it's clearly not getting better. so these are some of the things that we're working on in the background.

Andrea Ingmire: All the instances are the same as

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah. Yeah.

Kyle Johnson: Yeah.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: And I mean, you guys have probably all worked with somebody that appears to not be doing their part of the tasks or what they are doing, you're having to fix. somebody that is supposed to be leading a team but just keeps missing deadlines. It's really hard to follow in those footsteps.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: So I think we have a lot of things even just around who we have here, who we want to keep here, and what we're going to do with it. and any ideas are welcomed with how we can look at that.

Kyle Johnson: and then three weeks later it's still not done correctly and I just have to do it anyway over a weekend or a night or something like that and I don't know Karan you might be able to speak to that too I mean just being let down when you give everybody you give them every opportunity to succeed every tool to succeed and then in the end you just have to do it anyway

Karan Rajkhullar: Yeah. my approach has been slightly different than yours to deal with that.

Karan Rajkhullar: As we've talked about before, Kyle, my approach it has increased my workload, but in kind of the opposite way where instead of me fixing it afterwards, I just have to force myself to kind of document everything step by step to the point where I'm basically doing it anyway. so my extra time usage is a lot more front-loaded I guess. but yeah, it still very much affects me. Yeah.

Andrea Ingmire: Jody, that's exactly why I asked you for someone for APS…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Mhm. Right. Yeah.

Andrea Ingmire: because Kyle's basically handholding our dev and just doesn't have time for it. It's, a question over Slack and then another question over Slack and then, hey, can we meet and a 30 minute meeting that is rehashing everything that was already explained over Slack and that's just not stuff that he should be spending his time on.  So, we just needed someone else to be able to be the sounding board to be able to answer some questions just till we get through this one progress point to get this one thing deployed.

Kyle Johnson: steps. so they were left in a pickle where things were half done and it was broken in production and the only person to fix it is me. And that's the kind of stuff that it shouldn't happen. And it number one never should have happened because everything should have been validated days before, and approved by cron myself someone else who really knows what's going on. an example with the ABS thing too is the code that I wrote for that I did months ago and I had no clue of how Avalora the API worked at all, right? And then wrote the code for it and now somehow I'm the expert on it and no one else knows anything about it. part of that's on me for not also, advising more people on what to do, but the other part of it is I'm not that unique, right? Other people can read a product guide and…

### 00:40:00

Karan Rajkhullar: Right.

Kyle Johnson: figure out how it works, right?

Kyle Johnson: But right now, we don't have a lot of those people that are either a willing to read that guide or b understand it to Google it even.

Andrea Ingmire: or even think to begin with. And that's one of the things that's super challenging,…

Kyle Johnson: They just want you to send it.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah, you have to trust it.

Andrea Ingmire: in that situation, I was shocked to hear that that wasn't even validated in advance because I've heard so many great things about this dev.  And part of one of my biggest challenges in the CSM role is that so many people just tell me someone's great and how do I not believe when I hear this person is great? Yeah. And I've run into so many situations where I'm like, "Okay, whose rosecolored glasses were a hundred times amplified here?  literally lying or who's just lying to themselves and refusing to see it.

Andrea Ingmire: You can't put a new person on a project who you can say does XYZ and they have no idea how to even get to bad analogy but what is being reported and what is actually the capability are so there's such a big discrepancy that it just feels like it's an immeasurable hurdle.

Kyle Johnson: Yeah.

Andrea Ingmire: What do you do with that? Hey client, yes, this person has all these same skills. That's what I was told and that's what I'm telling you. And then we all find out together that that's not true. You're supposed to do in that case, …

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: That's another area to improve. Truthfully, our skills matrix is very subjective.

Karan Rajkhullar: Yeah.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: People have given themselves fives only because they took a trail head. I'm sorry,…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: but I've taken I don't know, 1500 trail heads. I'm an all-star ranger. I don't think I would put myself on a five for most things in the skills Exactly. Another area of opportunity for us to be better because when I are trying to staff a project and we see that QAB has a seven on Selenium automation tool out of 10\. I think cool this person has a seven. I can put them on this project. When come to find out they have never done any hands-on experience but they still gave themselves a seven.

Andrea Ingmire: and the fact that that's self-reported is inherently flawed.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: So it's very hard to staff.

Andrea Ingmire: I honestly don't think I remember that that was self-reported.

Karan Rajkhullar: I

Andrea Ingmire: I forgot that that's…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah. Mhm. Yeah.

Andrea Ingmire:

Andrea Ingmire: how that happens. That's absurd. there needs to be someone to wait for that number being decided.

Kyle Johnson: We just need our own internal testing platform,…

Kyle Johnson: and we can set something like that up and we can take more or less base our tests off of what would be the cert test but make it 10 times harder purposely because we want people to be very very prepared for those certifications and also because we don't want everyone to get a 10\. It's not possible. You're never going to know everything. and we update those tests every time there's a release.

Kyle Johnson: even 6 months ahead of time when the notes come out and…

Kyle Johnson: we keep everyone up to speed and we make it a requirement.

Karan Rajkhullar: Are you saying for the skills matrix you take the test and…

Karan Rajkhullar: then you can derive your number from I think that's a good idea.

Kyle Johnson: Yep.

Karan Rajkhullar: I think another idea and maybe it could be in tandem. I really do think a strong code review system would solve a lot of these issues. I know I bring it up pretty much every time I talk,…

Andrea Ingmire: Shut up.

Karan Rajkhullar: but …

Kyle Johnson: Show it off.

Karan Rajkhullar: but yeah.

Kyle Johnson: Show it off. Yep.

Karan Rajkhullar: Yeah. so what I have right now isn't Yeah. so this right now is actually neither the code review tool or…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: I'm putting you over here.

Karan Rajkhullar: the code locker tool. This is actually what I whipped up as kind of a proof of concept of the base of what this could look like. So, yeah, can you guys see my screen? Okay, perfect.  So, Kyle, this is because, Kyle and I were talking last night and we were talking about, how to integrate AI into our other two ideas, which is the code locker tool and the code review system. And so, this thing that I whipped up is just a template for us to use. it's pretty simple. We just have the main repository here.

### 00:45:00

Karan Rajkhullar: we have a test branch that I made and then I hooked it up to this GitHub action and whenever there's a pull request AI automatically takes a look at all the differences and does a baseline code review. So it'll just point out anything it sees that it considers flawed.  There's some issues with this for our use case where the GitHub action that's utilized here is very generic. It's not specific to Salesforce. So, it's not pointing out any Salesforce best practice issues. But the actual GitHub action is open source. So, I figured out where we would even need to change to make it more specific to us, but we could change it to scan for really anything.

Karan Rajkhullar: I think just baseline will just make it more specific for Salesforce. But what I really wanted to talk about with this template is kind of the highle ideas that I have for code review and code lock So for code review what I'm thinking probably wouldn't even involve a git repo maybe. basically I'm just thinking we have a pool of people. maybe we have multiple pools of people.  depending on expertise. So maybe there's a pool of people that are experts in marketing cloud, maybe there's a pool of people that are experts in Lightning Web Components. you can have different pools of people who we designate as good enough to be reviewing that niche. and then we have the rest of the people, right?

Karan Rajkhullar: we'll have to figure out a way to segment them in terms of their general skill within that niche however we want to do it. because honestly right now it might be a little difficult to have that group based setup.  Maybe we just have general architects at the top who review everything and then basically the high level idea is depending on where you fall in the ladder, you have a certain number of code reviews that you are required to do per month.

Karan Rajkhullar: So, for instance, if I'm a junior dev, I'm going to get paired up with a code reviewer and I'm going to need to show off one thing that I built for one of my clients and the code reviewer that's been assigned to review it for me is going to hop in a call with me. it'll be 30 minutes probably. and the junior dev will just have to go through what they built. and I keep saying code, but it really doesn't need to be code. It can be any solutions.  It can be an architecture document. It can be like a flow. and basically the reviewer will just provide feedback. and then we should have some sort of form where that feedback can get collected and then some sort of way to quantify that feedback. and have it linked to that person, right?

Karan Rajkhullar: and then now Andrea when someone says that someone's great instead of just taking their word for it, you can look in Salesforce or whatever other interface we set up and you can see okay they got a score of I don't know maybe I haven't thought too much of the grading system but let's just say we rate them from one to five or something. you can see, their average score is a three and maybe their first reviews were one and now they're five. So maybe they've improved, but to look out for certain niches that they've gotten ones at. so it just gives you a much better picture of that resource. and the reason I pulled up this git repo is because it doesn't just need to be with poll requests.

Karan Rajkhullar: we don't need to just do code reviews when we do poll requests. We can have AI in all aspects of our infrastructure that it makes sense to. I'm kind of transitioning over to Code Locker.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: I think that's great.

Karan Rajkhullar: So any questions or any comments about the code review process? any thoughts on that?  Yeah.

Andrea Ingmire: It sounds similar to what the original goal was with the techgov team and reviewing RAS and stuff. And I've learned that that process has gone pretty far downhill from what it was when I started. And also almost no onore resources know what it is or how to use it. and I'm running into a lot of Philippines people that don't know what it is or how to use it. And so it's clearly not something that has been cared enough about to be kept up to be a good standard. And this sounds a great revamping of that idea and making it better and…

### 00:50:00

Andrea Ingmire: and taking it further into being able to be used in a lot more things too. Sounds awesome.

Kyle Johnson: Yeah, basically there'd be a folder in here and…

Kyle Johnson: your developer would have to push to that folder their code for the casework or…

Kyle Johnson: their flow or whatever. and again that brings up also we need to make sure that people are actually using VS Code or something similar and not dev console so they can actually put things here.

Karan Rajkhullar: Yeah. …

Kyle Johnson: But then of course as soon as they push it's going to review it and it's going to format it in whatever necessary format we need, It's going to make it look nice. It's going to pick up things like hard-coded passwords or IDs and stuff like that. And it's not even going to let the person be able to actually push it anywhere. It's going to say, "Hey, you've got to fix all these things." Or it'll let them push it. And then we have a tracker and say, "Hey, you did this."

Kyle Johnson: you want to explain that?

Karan Rajkhullar: so what you're touching on, Kyle, is actually a different system as well. what this code review process I just talked about. I want it to be something that is hands-on and people actually hop into calls and review it together. the other thing that you're talking about is I actually didn't mention it so far, but it's kind of similar to what the code locker idea is, but it's project specific.

Karan Rajkhullar: so what Kyle was talking about is an idea we talked about briefly the other day where we should have a central GitHub repository where all information about all projects that we have lives and basically whenever a developer is working on that project whenever they make a change to that project or whenever they implement something for that project whenever they're going to they will first push it to this repository and the idea is  There will be a different branch for each project and the project won't just have the code. It will also have damn I wish I had time earlier. I would have set this up a little bit better so you guys could see it.

Karan Rajkhullar: but what I'm thinking is each branch for each project will have a documents folder I don't know project timeline folder resources folder and then the actual code and the implementation details folder and the reason I want to capture all that information in a central repository is because I think one thing that we need to really start implementing internally is I'm extremely biased, but I really do think it would be a massive benefit if we could figure out ways in our infrastructure to incorporate AI. And even if we're not going to incorporate AI right now with our project information because I know there are some data risk with that and data privacy considerations we need to take into account.

Karan Rajkhullar: we can at least set up our infrastructure in a way that once we do implement AI, we have everything for every project centralized in its own location and we can fully utilize AI to its full effect. so for instance, there's this one tool out there called Cursor that I'm kind of basing this model off of. Cursor is basically just a developer IDE that you can pop open and you can kind of talk to AI about all the files in your codebase.  And that's kind of a similar approach I want to take with this. I want to make this infrastructure ready for people to use tools like cursor with it. So if we have all the project information consolidated in one place now when you talk to AI about it, you're not just talking about isolated like code snippets. You're not just talking about one-off documents. You're talking within the actual context of the whole project.

Karan Rajkhullar: So mean that has massive benefit throughout the whole project life cycle. imagine you're getting a new resource and you need KT. What do you do instead of watching hours of KT videos and rounding through pages of documents? You just pull down this repository and you talk to your AI about it. You're like, "Hey, what has this project done in the past? these are the requirements for what I'm being brought on for. maybe we'll also have folders about what the clients liked and didn't like. I could ask the AI hey what did the client what sorts of design patterns do they respond well to in terms of solutions which do they not jive with? what doesn't work with their infrastructure their best practices.

Karan Rajkhullar: So Mhm.

Andrea Ingmire: That would be huge for getting actual KT accomplished because one of my biggest challenges is people say they've done KT and…

### 00:55:00

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: And they didn't,…

Andrea Ingmire: it they don't understand that this is the case I was working on when I left the project.

Karan Rajkhullar: Right. Yeah.

Andrea Ingmire: If you closed all your cases before you left the project and…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: right? Yeah.

Andrea Ingmire: you think you don't have to do KT.

Andrea Ingmire: Are you kidding me? there's a whole new developer coming onto this project that's never worked on anything involved with this project before. Just because there's not currently an open dev case doesn't mean they're going to be able to jump into the next dev case that gets opened and know how to do anything like what that happened to me multiple times in a row on one project.

Karan Rajkhullar: Exactly. Yeah.

Karan Rajkhullar: Exactly. And

Andrea Ingmire: I was and with good devs.

Andrea Ingmire: So I was told how do you think that you don't need to explain more about the org and the infrastructure and the client and what's going on here that's amazing.

Karan Rajkhullar: Yeah, exactly.

Karan Rajkhullar: I mean, it's a big pain point to receive KT and also give KT, So, this kind of shores up both of those.  Obviously we don't want all reliance on AI we'll have some sort of path up but the path off can be something like a 30-minute call hey look into these areas and here are some considerations that might not be in the repo so I'll just go through with you in a call but the rest of it you should be able to figure out and full transparency this is what I did with Certinia I didn't go through hours of footage I basically transcribed the recordings I pulled the documents down and I just talked

Karan Rajkhullar: to AI about it and within hours I was up to speed with what I needed to be. it truly is a 10x productivity boost. so basically just to sum up everything we talked about so far I know we're getting close to time or I guess I have time to stay on so…

Karan Rajkhullar: if anyone wants to stick on Perfect.

Kyle Johnson: Yeah, I'm good too…

Kyle Johnson: if you guys are.

Karan Rajkhullar: So yeah.

Andrea Ingmire: I'm good.

Karan Rajkhullar: …

Andrea Ingmire: I might just need to run and…

Karan Rajkhullar: so yeah,…

Andrea Ingmire: grab a snack real quick. Keep going.

Karan Rajkhullar: For so the code review process is what we talked about. Are those pretzels? Nice. Yeah. I wasn't sure if I read that wrong.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: protein pretzels. Yeah.

Karan Rajkhullar: Yeah. So, we got the nice. that's why they're called fits. That's a good name so yeah. the code review process. That's one.  And then we just talked about the project repository process. just want to finish that up real quick. so just to sum up the end goal is to implement AI with the project repository in the way that Kyle also mentioned.

Karan Rajkhullar: so not just AI in getting yourself up to speed or making solutions, but also AI in I just thought of something, so I'm going to say it, but it's kind of off the cuff, so I might be a little bit all over the place, but when a developer is going to make a change or they're adding a document or they're adding anything to this project branch, right, there should be some sort of validation that  the AI does and if it's big enough or if it meets certain criteria, Kyle and I will look it over anyone else we deem as the reviewers of technological best practices.

Karan Rajkhullar: and the idea that I just thought of was in the project folders themselves, we can have a set of rules for the AI to follow when when they're trying to review changes that you're pushing. So let's say for instance a certain project has a certain set of best practices that they follow but that's unique to them, instead of having to kind of just get generic responses from the AI about what's wrong with your code, you could get very very specific insights by having a centralized place where those rules live and those rules can change over time. They're always just going to be in one file and we'll just make the AI action in such a way that it always looked at that rule set before it actually validates your changes.

Karan Rajkhullar: So that way we can get very specific insights into someone's code quality and whether or not it's fit to actually be a part of the solution that we send off to the client. that's pretty much everything for system. any questions,…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: This is amazing.

Karan Rajkhullar: comments, any other direction like any ideation that you guys want to go down with that? Right. Right.

Kyle Johnson: I wanted to touch on with that too that it kind of gets rid of the need for the sharing of gear set passwords and all that because we just have one account, to push everything basically from GitHub. we pull everything from here after it's been validated and not the org itself because we always can't trust the orgs either. I mean things may change blah blah blah. We can't enforce the standards, right? But we can through here.

### 01:00:00

Karan Rajkhullar:

Karan Rajkhullar: Yeah. Yeah. if we can not only have this system but build it in a way where it also can link to the actual client's org and then this is where everything goes through. This is our centralized place where all of our developers push stuff to and then that's when it gets to the client. That would be insanely powerful. I think that would totally change the game internally. so yeah, that's something I didn't touch on too much when I was talking about it, but yeah, Kyle, that definitely final state what we'll need to have

Kyle Johnson: And Jody touching on and…

Kyle Johnson: Andrea too the issue of not being able to hand over to clients right now when they leave all of the cases and history and documents and all that stuff. That problem's gone because now it lives somewhere else and we can just clone their specific project repo and then give it to them. and that's got everything in it that we ever worked on.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah, Andrea,…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: I don't know if you know about that yet. the new Infosys machines do not allow us to download the attachments from the cases to share them with clients.

Andrea Ingmire: I don't think so about what specifically.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: So Joseph had to go and manually pull from individual cases. Luckily, the project was only three months long, but I'm thinking ahead about Taris. that's years of cases. So,

Andrea Ingmire: So if the client is interested in any of the attachments on any of the cases ever, we would not be able to download the attachments from the case on our new machines. So we can't download them at all or they prevent us from sending them. You can't prevent people from sending attachment. That would be ridiculous.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: So he normally writes out a small little query and it pulls and it puts it into the file. We can't do that anymore in the new machines because our internal ops team is actually on the infosys machines today. So we're learning what is and…

Andrea Ingmire: Right. Right.

Andrea Ingmire: That's not allowed.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: is not working. So hopefully it changes that.

Andrea Ingmire: What's the reasoning for that not being allowed?  Wow. Yeah.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: It's just how the Infosys security permissions are right now. So, we're going to learn a lot of things over the next several months. will Karan continue to be able to access GitHub on his machine? We don't know.

Karan Rajkhullar: the emphasis or…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Right.

Karan Rajkhullar: simplifice it that much.

Kyle Johnson: And there's a lot of clients that just don't care. However, the work gets done,…

Karan Rajkhullar: Yeah. right?

Kyle Johnson: it gets done because there's people that we can't trust. Absolutely. but then this also brings up having a completely separate simplist. Okay, we know they've got an Infosys one, but can we have one that is just a simplest laptop where it doesn't have any of the s\*\*\* on it but we can't get to,…

Kyle Johnson: any of the internal stuff or whatever, but we can still use it for development and other things like that. Otherwise, we'll just be on a personal laptop anyway, right? But

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: And…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: I think honestly if there is a way that we could present that it seems logical to people outside of this group. we already possess the simplest laptop. we possess the Infosys laptop. We could save a buttload of money not having to ship these laptops back. because we already have them. We already work on them.

Kyle Johnson: Yep.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: That's a really good thought. because I personally want to keep this laptop because I have no issues with it.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: But I think that that might be a better proposal moving forward…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: because they're not going to do anything with these laptops other than hopefully recycle them properly or donate them or…

Karan Rajkhullar: What? Yes.

Andrea Ingmire: That's what I was going to ask.

Andrea Ingmire: What are they even going to do with them when we send it back? they're not going to make money off of us sending back the laptop.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: they're just going to sit in the Utah office and collect dust.

Kyle Johnson: Yeah. Yeah.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: But you figure what it's going to be anywhere from 20 to $40 for each one of us to ship our laptop back. And that's if we only have one.

### 01:05:00

Kyle Johnson: I mean,…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: We've got people that have two right now.

Kyle Johnson: am I talked to I'm confused.

Karan Rajkhullar: I think I have three.

Kyle Johnson: It was basically over $100 per laptop they shipped due to the insurance and…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: There you go. Yeah.

Kyle Johnson: everything they put on it.

Karan Rajkhullar: Is this something that we can like…

Karan Rajkhullar: because it just feels it's just like ignoring the fact that we're kind of two different entities that operate in different ways at least when we operate at our best we operate in different ways. and maybe this is something that if we can prove to them that we should be doing our types of projects because we deliver them well.

Karan Rajkhullar: Maybe if we can prove that first, then we can just extend that to let us operate the way that we want to with our infrastructure and our laptops and kind of use the success with the project that's kind of a foot in the door to even broader changes. I mean, I don't know…

Kyle Johnson: Yeah.

Karan Rajkhullar:

Karan Rajkhullar: how those conversations work. I'm kind of just speaking on a high level I don't know how

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Normally I would drag that over to Shane Howard,…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: but since he's gone, it puts us in a little bit more of an interesting spot, but I've been having more calls with Deepo lately. I feel like we could probably put something in front of him to plead our case.

Karan Rajkhullar: Mhm.  Right. Yeah.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: I honestly don't see any downside to us maintaining these extra laptops except that we have an extra laptop on our desk. and who's to say that it's even going to be open every day? We might be on our Infosys machine for three days straight and maybe on the fourth day we need to hop on our simplest machine to do something else that we can't do on our Infosys machine.

Kyle Johnson: And think of the amount of overhead and BS tech cases that go to SIM or Infosys that this would cut out because we can do it ourselves. We just use a different device.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah, we've got our amazing internal IT team that can help us with things.

Kyle Johnson: And Infosys can remotely wipe whatever they need to off of our existing laptops, whatever crap that they've put on there amongst the simplest stuff as So it's just entirely us and we manage it. And of course it …

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah. Yeah.

Kyle Johnson: if we ever screw up it's on us too, we take the responsibility and I mean we've got what let's say 200 laptops $100 a piece. They're just going to get rid of them anyway. Probably more than that. Yeah.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah. I mean, I don't think they're going to revive them.

Andrea Ingmire: There's more than 200 left here.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: You figure you've got all the laptops got replaced. So, you've got US, Canada, Philippines, Australia. that's a lot of machines. That's a lot of international shipping.

Andrea Ingmire: About like 700 people probably something like that. That's another example of often many of the challenges and…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: It's a lot of money.

Kyle Johnson: Yeah, absolutely is.

Andrea Ingmire: things that I just can't figure out why. It all comes back to everything that I'm seeing from them is just so shortsighted. It's such a short-sighted idea that we have to send these machines back. There's no need for that.  What are they benefiting from by getting the machines?

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: people can get offered a payroll deduction form and buy the laptops, right? that's the easiest solution. But so far that hasn't been approved yet because I really want this machine. I love this machine. It works great. I've had it the entire time that I've had a simplless laptop. It works  It might be that I have some really cool stickers on it that I don't want to lose, but it works for me. And I think that, that was the first thing I asked Shane when we were on that call. I said, "Is there any way to have an employee purchase program for these?" mainly and I'll just go down this rabbit hole. I have a MacBook. It's got the little touch bar at the top.

### 01:10:00

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: The new MacBooks don't have that. I would like to maintain this because of that Touch Bar alone. but it makes sense for us to have that as being the number one option. And of course, if our laptop is garbage, obviously we want to send it back.  But if it's a good running machine and it's working for us, we should have the option to either buy it or you guys are proposing, we wipe off what needs to be wiped off and we use it for, developing things and being creative but still being able to share them across the system.

Karan Rajkhullar: Yeah, I don't understand why the employee buyback program isn't a thing.

Karan Rajkhullar: That only saves implicit money. That only saves time and it makes sense. Yeah.  I don't know why that isn't an option.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah. …

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: I've been here since when I started it, I had to use my own machine because it was in the height of the pandemic when laptops weren't available. So, I think I got this machine in November of 2020\. Now, granted, it's four years old, but this thing's been solid, and …

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: I think I'll probably, if given the opportunity, use it till it dies. or…

Karan Rajkhullar: Yeah.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: just it can't support the new Mac OS anymore. But I'm already seeing in IT channel about people not being able to have Slack on their Windows machines. I'm seeing Zscaler issues. I'm seeing Jamif issues.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: It's already started and we're not even using them consistently.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: So, There's big concerns about are we going to be down for weeks or months on end?

Karan Rajkhullar: Yeah. Yeah.

Karan Rajkhullar: I looked at the channel today. there were reports today too of I think zcaler issues. It's insane.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah. Yeah.

Karan Rajkhullar: Yeah. Yeah.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: If we have to authenticate and we need to have that thing running, they need to ensure that it's going to work while it's doing its thing.

Kyle Johnson: And there's other options out there.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: This machine that I'm on now does not have Zcaler.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: It's an on the exception list. I don't log into Zcaler ever. It's not even on my machine.

Kyle Johnson: Nice. Yeah.

Karan Rajkhullar: Lucky. my god.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: No, the only reason and I went probably six weeks battling about this, but it kept kicking me off in the middle of a client call. Yeah. it would just drop my internet. it did it three times on a 45 minute call and…

Karan Rajkhullar: My god.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: and when you want to get back in it's super slow or you couldn't put a detachment in Slack. nothing was working and so it was miserable. But we found out that disabling Zcaler worked. I'm still compliant with all the security needs.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: I've got, all the updates. It shuts down when it needs to and that's it. So, I don't ask questions.

Andrea Ingmire: Wait, so they're telling us that we have to connect to Zcaler in order to be up to date with all the security stuff. How are you still up to date without that? They're just lying to us.

Kyle Johnson: because it's not true.

Andrea Ingmire: They're just lying to us.

Kyle Johnson: Because it's not true.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah. Yeah.

Kyle Johnson: Yeah. The way that it gets pushed through Azure and everything that Zcaler would mean nothing. Basically, what Zcaler is doing is making sure you don't download something that you shouldn't and…

Kyle Johnson: it's isolated on your machine. in that scenario,…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah.

Kyle Johnson: but yeah, all the updates and everything like that still going to run no matter what. Zcaler is really what they're going to use to do all the key logging and everything else. applications similar. I believe the one on the new laptop is what Guardian or something like that. But yeah, that's the real purpose of Zscaler is to make sure that everything on your machine is isolated if you download something you shouldn't and also to keep track of what you're doing.

Andrea Ingmire: Yeah, that's

Karan Rajkhullar: It's kind of crazy that there's a key logger for real.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: I kept saying that that was going to exist or that it already existed and we kept getting told no. it's there.

Karan Rajkhullar: Yeah, that's crazy.

Kyle Johnson: Yeah. Yeah.

Andrea Ingmire: It's there on our existing laptops or only the new ones?

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Definitely the new ones.

Andrea Ingmire: Yeah, but is it so gross?

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: I wouldn't doubt it's here now. What do you guys think?

Kyle Johnson: I'm 100% sure that it's on here.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: So when we're on,…

Kyle Johnson: I can check.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: video calls like this and we're not constantly tinkity tinking on the keyboard, it looks bad. Or if I'm just scrolling with my mouse, because I'm trying to find a resource for something and I'm doing that for an hour, it looks like I'm not doing much.

### 01:15:00

Karan Rajkhullar: Do you think they use that for any internal metrics? do they Yeah,…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: I hope not.

Karan Rajkhullar: That'd be really out of touch…

Karan Rajkhullar: if they did that. It doesn't even make sense. it's not even useful information.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: I worked for a company that they actually monitored every like…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: how many keys you touched an hour and management would get a report about it. It was really wracking.

Karan Rajkhullar: That's like the You just want to

Andrea Ingmire: Yeah, I was going to say why.

Andrea Ingmire: What is the point of that?

Kyle Johnson: at this LOE is eight hours and…

Kyle Johnson: they do it in 30 minutes but we still collect eight hours worth of pay from the client I don't care that they're not going to do anything the other seven and a half hours I mean sure we want them to take on more tickets but at the same time I mean that's the kind of stuff that you earn by being exceptionally good at your job I don't know…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Avalera expert.

Kyle Johnson:

Kyle Johnson: where that came Yeah.

Karan Rajkhullar: Okay.

Karan Rajkhullar: What we say?

Kyle Johnson: I'm just taking a look on here to see if it'll let me actually see in the task manager what all is going on here and looking for something suspicious. But there's so much stuff going on that dig through, take some time and figure out which application that it actually is.

Karan Rajkhullar: How are you looking for that? Are you just looking for cuz I don't think it would make itself obvious.

Kyle Johnson: No, it won't. It'll be just some sort of vaguely named thing running within one of the system folders.

Karan Rajkhullar: Yeah. Yeah. Some key loggers actually name themselves very similarly to core Windows processes that you need and…

Kyle Johnson: Yeah.

Karan Rajkhullar:

Karan Rajkhullar: they'll have one letter off. So yeah, it's a difficult to spot.

Karan Rajkhullar: Yeah, right.

Andrea Ingmire: are not just labeling themselves as big brother.

Andrea Ingmire: That'd be a little too obvious. Yeah, I do my previous personal laptop it's so old and it's been so useless and decrepit and I do a lot of stuff on my work laptop now.

Andrea Ingmire: And when I got the new one and I realized just how much more restrictive that's going to be, I was like, it's time to get a new personal laptop. Luckily, it was right around Black Friday time, so I got a pretty good deal on it. But I realized that pretty quickly.

Karan Rajkhullar: Lucky timing.

Karan Rajkhullar: Just a quick

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah, I mean I would honestly say that…

Kyle Johnson: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: if you guys can at all possible on your new machines not do anything not workrelated,…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: it's probably going to benefit everybody that isn't workrelated.

Karan Rajkhullar: not do anything…

Karan Rajkhullar: what related. Okay, gotcha. Right. Yeah.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Just to see how things go.

Karan Rajkhullar: Just a quick note, I have to drop in a little bit. so is it okay if I just go over the third thing that I have in mind and then perfect. so the third thing that I have in mind is something that I call the code locker. but it doesn't Sorry, I'm going all over the place a little bit, but yeah, it's something called the code locker. basically what I'm thinking is it'll be another git repo with its own AI capabilities as and the idea is that whenever someone on a project has to build something that they think could be extrapolated out to something more generic.

Karan Rajkhullar: basically what they would do is they would go to either directly to the repo or what I prefer for the code locker is we have some sort of interface on top of the repo. and then people can kind of just add their solutions to it. They can look at other people's solutions. They can search for solutions. they can look for solutions by tag maybe the solutions are tagged for better searchability. So maybe a solution can be tagged as If it's an Apex snippet or something maybe if it's specific to marketing cloud or some other type of cloud, it'll have those tags as well.

### 01:20:00

Karan Rajkhullar: and another reason I like having an interface on top of the repo instead of just having it be the repo is because a big part of it is I want it to be very easy for people to find the solution. So I don't want them to have to go through the git repo itself and find where a solution might be.  I want them to literally maybe talk to an AI agent and be like, "Hey, this is my need. it's for this client." And maybe even We can link to the project repo and then the AI would understand, it's this project with all these considerations to keep in mind. and then I would say, yeah, I'm on this project and these are the things I need to do. is there anything in the code locker tool that I can use that would help me out?

Karan Rajkhullar: and then it would look through the code blocker tool and just spit out some solutions that could be relevant. that way the user doesn't even need to explore anything themselves. it's all just assisted with and AI is very good at doing that where it takes your sentence, it understands the semantic meaning and it also can understand the semantic meaning of code.  So it can map those two things together and kind of spit that another thing I was thinking of just in the back of my head, I know earlier in this call I mentioned I wasn't sure if the code review should also be in a git repo. but now that I think about it, I think everything should be in a git repo. And the reason I say that is because I think once we have these systems in place, we can actually string them together in a way that makes each of them better than the sum of their parts.

Karan Rajkhullar: So for instance, if you think about the project repo, so we have three repos in our mind. We have the code review repo, we have the project repo, and we have the code locker repo. So let's say let's start with the project our base project repo the one we already discussed is just a central repository for information and code and solutions related to that project.  But could you imagine let's say a developer made a change for Certinia, right?

Karan Rajkhullar: let's say I do something for Catinia, I push it to the project repo and instead of me having to step back and think about hey can this be generified and put into the code locker what if the AI who's actually doing the merging is hey the thing you built here is actually generic and taking a look at the other projects that are in this repo I think this could be applicable to other projects.  So what I'm going to do is I'm going to generify this code snippet. I'm going to take out everything related to Certinia and I'm going to put it in the code locker tool with the correct tags. So now we have a system where people can very fast.

Karan Rajkhullar: people can utilize AI to come up with solutions really fast and then every single time they add a new solution to a project that gets potentially added to the final code locker tool making the whole system stronger over time. So yeah, that's kind of what I'm thinking. that's what I'm going to honestly I'm just going to start building out proof of concept for this. in my day-to-day now, even especially in my personal life, I use AI to code a lot and it's been increasing my productivity over 10 times. And so, I definitely think I'll have a PC of these.

Karan Rajkhullar: Even if we want a front end for this I can have it pretty much done in a week. I think I can get a PC of all three of these systems in a relatively short time. and then maybe on our next call we can all sync and…

Karan Rajkhullar: and I can show them off and we can see how we can get them finalized. But I want to hear you guys thoughts.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: any concerns about poisoning the …

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: like having somebody putting bad data into the AI Okay.

Karan Rajkhullar: There's concern for that,…

Karan Rajkhullar: but we can account for that with We can have AI that looks over the code and reviews it and if it determines that it's flop, it'll call it out. to Kyle's point earlier with the AI code review if the AI finds something that's really alarming it should call that out and then we should dig into it further yeah

### 01:25:00

Kyle Johnson: And we have worked with in the past anyway enterprise level clients that do something very similar to this where they have 15 different sandboxes but everything actually goes to production from GitHub and all their different sandboxes all their different people working on various things all push to the same repo that has the same standards. So no team is working under completely different standards. Everyone has the same and…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Okay.

Kyle Johnson: then yeah as soon as with Motorola you would push to the repo and then they have it set up to where it had to meet all the criteria that they wanted to see personally. So it had to be formatted correctly. It couldn't be any hard-coded IDs or anything like that.  And if it didn't meet that, it just flagged it immediately, sent it to a senior person at Motorola, and then they had to go back and they meet with that person, go like, "Hey, what's going on here? let's take a look at this. Let's get this cleaned up.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yep.

Karan Rajkhullar: a lot of reasons. one is obviously we can do the idea of potentially hooking up CI/CD with this and actually making it automatically deploy to projects that would be absolutely huge. another thing is once we're using the system for a good amount of time, GitHub one of it primary strengths is version control and history tracking. So, not only will we have this infrastructure in place to continuously grow, but we'll have a history of everything. so let's say and I can't really think of anything that would be useful for right now, but I'm sure Yeah,…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: accountability. Yeah.

Karan Rajkhullar: accountability. and I don't know dude GitHub git in general is just such a flexible system that I think if we build our infrastructure on this we can scale to no limit basically. So yeah,…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah. This is amazing.

Kyle Johnson: Yeah, that was one of the things that we were originally going to talk about is kind of like…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: I love it.

Karan Rajkhullar: I hope next week I'll have something to show you guys something a little bit more thorough.

Kyle Johnson: what day or time worked for everybody because I know everybody's really busy.  But kind of one of the things Andre and I talked about yesterday it's kind of cool to be able to end the workday kind of mid workday on a Friday get together as a group and  Yeah.

Karan Rajkhullar: Okay. Yeah.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah. And…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: then I sent a message to Kyle just because we had been working on this too yesterday. so I'm in the change champions group. so I have a quarterly meeting with other leaders in the company that get one-on-one time with SESH.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: So, I'll be letting you guys know when those meetings are so that way the month before we can really work to get notes to take to that meeting.

Karan Rajkhullar: Perfect.

Karan Rajkhullar: Yeah, that's awesome. That's a good idea.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah. Yeah.

Karan Rajkhullar: I'm super

Kyle Johnson: Yeah.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Here's…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: what I'll leave you guys with is that there has been a lot of negativity that happened directly that may have been inaccurately disposed disseminated to all of us, things like that. This group here is just overflowing with positivity and support. And if we can spread that out to anybody we interact with, I think we're going to be in a really good place because even if it's not coming directly from Jess or hire, we are still, people at the company that people can trust, they know us.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: let's get everybody to kind of get on this bandwagon and see what we can do because I think otherwise it's just going to keep getting more and more frustrating and I think that's the last thing any of us want. So, let's just make this grow rather than having a spreading cancer.

Karan Rajkhullar: Yeah, agree.

Kyle Johnson: Whatever we can every day to just grow this perception of our company because we are the best. we talked over and over and over again in this and there's other people out here at the company like us that aren't here today. but we can't let them get burnt out. We can't let them get, trotten over. yeah, we just got to increase the morale all across the board. I mean, it's just a immediate need. Absolutely. The positivity thing is huge.

### 01:30:00

Kyle Johnson: just everybody I think knowing that we're doing something actively and caring about them is huge and I think a lot of people need to be reminded that we do care about you.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah, for sure.

Kyle Johnson: Yeah, this has been great.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: I can only see this going up.

Karan Rajkhullar: Yeah. …

Kyle Johnson:

Kyle Johnson: Yeah. Yep. Yeah. next week I guess from me I'll continue to just kind of brainstorm on things too and Karan I'd love to help you get the good get stuff set up.

Karan Rajkhullar: yeah. Yeah.

Kyle Johnson: Jody, one of the other things that I kind of wanted to keep brainstorming on is going back to being able to disseminate information amongst the managers and the team members better. how can we change our managerial structure to get information to people better,…

Kyle Johnson: right? And that's yeah,…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah, I've got a whole script for you on that.

Kyle Johnson: just something that's kind of like what we talked about on our 101 the other day and making certain roles more billable and stuff like that and more profitable and Marshall and I tal talked about that earlier too. So, lots of ideas out there and just we'll just keep rolling with stuff because we know that we'll get it done.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Absolutely. And it takes a village. And our village might be six strong right now, but give it time. It'll get bigger.

Kyle Johnson: Yeah, that's another thing. who else should we get in here? I mean,…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: I personally think that we need to get some folks in here from the Philippines.

Kyle Johnson: yeah. yeah. Yep.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Top names in my mind is like Kane.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Jerick de los Santos is another good name. Rio, just some and yeah, I know I just rattled off like some heavy devs, but those are some really great guys that I think could do some influence. Kane was a people manager. He's not anymore.  So, maybe just having that perspective of changing very highly visible roles would be pretty good to have.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: and just how can we collectively work together better where our Philippines counterparts feel comfortable bringing a negative situation to us or about us to somebody who can do something about it and how we can stop making it look like we're tattling on them on the incident tracker, that kind of thing. So, I think there's a lot of opportunities there. but I think if we're looking for players in the game that aren't necessarily leadership, Kane, Rio, Jerick, I think would be very good choices or anybody that you guys would think that you've interacted with that would make a good addition to this, too. yeah. I love Mike.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah. Yeah.

Kyle Johnson: He's a consultant, And that's the kind of people we want, not just Yeah.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: I mean, Mike Mike and I worked on Kamasu together for three years, and he has made such a reputation with that client that I can tell you right now, if we took him off, they would be so mad.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: they would be so mad. And he's so good and his communication His work is good. I mean, I know I can always count on him. And I agree with you. He would be a great addition to this as well. Pending. He works on Fridays.

Kyle Johnson: Wait. I think he does.

Kyle Johnson: No. Yeah.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah. Yeah. I feel like he's a Friday guy…

Kyle Johnson: Yeah. that's another thing too.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: because I think Michelle's the Monday person.

Kyle Johnson: Actually dont other than the people that I've worked with directly, I don't know a lot of the Philippines leadership really that and that's another thing too is that, how are we supposed to really properly communicate about the progress of offshore resources if we don't really know their manager very well? or really even know who they are. And Yeah. But I mean I don't have any real knowledge of …

### 01:35:00

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: We don't have a relationship.

Kyle Johnson: exactly. I don't know really much about that person or really how they like to manage their personnel because it's all subjective, right? It's like every person has a different personality and…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah. …

Kyle Johnson: and treats managing a different way. so when you kind of just come in hot and don't know those other subjectives, right, it can shoot you in the foot.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: and we're also working on that too. so right now our team leads or myself, I meet with my team every week individually. the way that it works over in the Philippines is the team lead meets with their whole team. So there's never really that one-on-one I feel comfortable bringing something to the table in this group setting. We're changing that.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: So, I think you might see a change in people's performance or…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: behaviors just based off of that alone. So, we just recently discovered this was a thing. So, we need everybody to be aligned. Yeah, one-on- ones have to happen. maybe weekly is overkill, but I mean I feel like at least from the people that report to me, they need it. Yep.

Kyle Johnson: Yep. Yeah.

Kyle Johnson: And I think that the trust in knowing that when you have those one-on- ones that it's, a safe environment and that you can talk about anything, whether it's frustrations on a project or personal stuff if you have to or, something else you're mad about, maybe you need to, air a grievance on somebody else on the team that left you out to dry and nobody knows, whatever. But a safe environment where, things can be communicated like that because otherwise  We just never really and then people stay silent for months and they get burnt out or they get pissed off and they leave and we didn't know what was really going on. So

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: One of the biggest reasons that people leave the Philippines team is the night shift. I don't know if either of you guys have ever worked third shift. I did it for three months and I was done. it is very hard on your mental well-being, your family. that is a lot of the feedback we get that it's night shift and health related issues due to night shift.  So, if there were one-on- ones happening rather than these group team weekly meetings, I think we might have been able to intercept that a little sooner. And there is a day shift. Our Philippines team gets a night shift differential. They get a little more money to work that awful shift, but there is an option to put people on dayshift.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: And if it means that somebody's going to be healthy and productive and still working here, we need to be able to offer that. But if we don't know that things are going on because there aren't one-on- ones happening, then we're going to lose people. And that's why this has become such a prevalent thing that we need to fix and…

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: that will be changed in January.

Kyle Johnson: Yeah. Yeah.

Karan Rajkhullar: Ju just real quick guys I need to drop sorry…

Karan Rajkhullar: but thank you guys so much for letting me gush about AI for a little bit. That was really dude I don't give me that option.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Yeah, I love it. you can gush about AI anytime you want, Karan. Yeah.

Karan Rajkhullar: I will take over all these. Cool. Thank you guys so much. Have a great weekend.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Thanks, Karan.

Kyle Johnson:

Kyle Johnson: Hey, you too.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: Take care.

Jodi vonSpreckelsen: How do you think it went?

Kyle Johnson: Yeah, I think this has gone really well.
